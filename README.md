# Comparing the Performance of Stochastic Algorithms in Generating Adversarial Attacks on Image Classifiers

This project aims to compare the performance of three stochastic algorithms in generating adversarial attacks on image classifiers:
1. DeepSearch, from the paper *Deepsearch: A Simple And Effective Blackbox Attack For Deep Neural Networks* by F. Zhang, S. Chowdhury, and M. Christakis
2. POBA-GA, from the paper *POBA-GA: Perturbation Optimized Black-Box Adversarial Attacks Via Genetic Algorithm* by J. Chen, M. Su, S. Shen, H. Xiong, and H. Zheng
3. PSO, from the paper *Attacking Black-Box Image Classifiers With Particle Swarm Optimization* by Q. Zhang, K. Wang, W. Zhang and J. Hu
